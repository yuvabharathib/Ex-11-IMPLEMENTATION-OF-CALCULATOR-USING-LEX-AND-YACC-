IMPLEMENTATION OF CALCULATOR USING LEX AND YACC 
# Date :
# Aim :
To implement a calculator using LEX and YACC.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .l extension.
3. In the lex program, write the translation rules for the various mathematical functions.
4. Write a program in the vi editor and save it with .y extension.
5. Compile the lex program with lex compiler to produce output file as lex.yy.c. eg $ lex filename.l
6. Compile the yacc program with yacc compiler to produce output file as y.tab.c. eg $ yacc –d arith_id.y
7. Compile these with the C compiler as gcc lex.yy.c y.tab.c
8. Enter an expression as input and it is evaluated and the answer is displayed as output.
